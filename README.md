Hi, I’m Pablo Genero, from San Francisco, Córdoba, Argetina. 
I have a degree in Accounting, and I am currently studying a diploma in Business Data Analytics, intended for professionals in economics and business. 
I also work as an administrative analyst at ARCOR SAIC, an argentine multinational company in the mass consumption sector.
I really enjoy working on analysis tasks, manipulating different types of data, being able to generate visualizations.
I like to learn and face challenges that require thinking creative solutions.

In this repository, I have uploaded some of the work and practices that I am developing as I progress in my data studies.

🛠 Some tools that I use:
+ Excel
+ R
+ Power BI
+ Mycrostrategy
+ MySQL
+ Pentaho

👨🏼‍🎓 I’m currently learning Python
